Todo List

This is a todo list that I will work on for several weeks at Code The Dream.

Installation instructions:

1. Open your terminal (make sure you have Node.js or NPM installed already) and use "git clone" followed by the repository URL or the SSH key .
2. Navigate to the project directory. You cando this by using "cd" to go to the desired folder.
3. Install dependencies. You can do this by typing "npm install" in the terminal.
4. Run the project by typing "npm run dev" into the terminal. Then type "o", to open the website in your browser. This starts a local development server.
